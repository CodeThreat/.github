# CodeThreat SAST 

## ðŸš€ Roadmap 
Our mission is to empower developers with a powerful SAST tool that seamlessly integrates into their workflows, helping them identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities from the earliest stages of development.

### Our Vision

We envision a world where secure code is not an afterthought but an intrinsic part of every developer's mindset. By building an intelligent SAST Center, we aim to enable teams to proactively detect and address security issues, bolstering the overall security posture of software projects.

# CodeThreat SAST 

## üöÄ Roadmap 
Our mission is to empower developers with a powerful SAST tool that seamlessly integrates into their workflows, helping them identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities from the earliest stages of development.

### Our Vision

We envision a world where secure code is not an afterthought but an intrinsic part of every developer's mindset. By building an intelligent SAST Center, we aim to enable teams to proactively detect and address security issues, bolstering the overall security posture of software projects.

### üõ£Ô∏è The Road Ahead

 Our roadmap outlines key milestones and enhancements that will shape our app to be more user-friendly and precise about dataflow analysis

1. **Dataflow Engine Improvements**: Expand our SAST Center's rule sets to detect even the most complex and elusive security vulnerabilities, tailored to different programming languages and frameworks. We'll be focusing on more advanced dataflow analysis techniques to support more complex code scenerios.

2. **Intelligent Remediation Suggestions**: Empower developers with actionable insights by suggesting appropriate fixes and best practices to address identified security flaws.

3. **Enhanced Integrations**: Seamlessly integrate with a diverse range of version control systems, issue trackers, and CI/CD tools, providing teams with a unified security experience.

4. **Software Composition Analysis**: Developing SCA Module to analyze project metadata and package manager dependencies, enhancing the project overview.
